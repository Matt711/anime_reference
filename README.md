# anime_reference

## Installing
### Via `pip`
I wrote this library to quickly get summaries from my favourite anime episodes. Hopefully, you find it easy to use.
Install using the following command:

```
pip install anime-reference
```

### Via GitHub
Alternatively, you can just clone this repo and import the libraries at your own discretion.

### Documentation
Currently, the package can get per episode summaries for a few anime titles.
The package will be expanding to include more and other content as well, but this is a start.

For full details on the Documentation please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/Matt711/anime_reference/blob/master/Documentation.md).
